#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 - Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It involves a disciplined approach to building reliable, efficient, and maintainable software products. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- MILESTONE 1 -  The First Software Bug (1947): Grace Hopper discovered a moth trapped in a relay, leading to the term "bug" to describe software errors. This incident highlighted the need for systematic debugging and testing practices.
MILESTONE 2 - Structured Programming (1960s): Structured programming introduced a more disciplined approach to software development, emphasizing modularity, top-down design, and control flow constructs.
MILESTONE 3 - Object-Oriented Programming (1970s): Object-oriented programming paradigm revolutionized software development by focusing on objects, their attributes, and behaviors, making code more reusable and maintainable.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements Gathering: Identifying and documenting the specific needs and goals of the software project.
2. Design: Creating a blueprint for the software, including its architecture, components, and interfaces.
3. Development: Writing the actual code for the software.
4. Testing: Verifying the software's functionality, performance, and reliability.
5. Deployment: Installing and making the software available to users.
6. Maintenance: Ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: A linear approach where each phase is completed before the next begins. It's suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a stable scope.

- Agile: An iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and frequent delivery of working software. It's ideal for projects with evolving requirements or uncertain environments.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Writes code, implements features, and tests the software.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests the software for defects and ensures it meets quality standards.
- Project Manager: Oversees the project, manages resources, and ensures it's completed on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Provide tools for coding, debugging, testing, and version control, improving efficiency and productivity. Examples include Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.
- VCS (Version Control Systems): Track changes to code over time, allowing for collaboration, rollback, and history management. Examples include Git, SVN, and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Complexity: Break down problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Use modular design and abstraction.
- Changing Requirements: Be adaptable and embrace changes. Use Agile methodologies for flexibility.
- Time Constraints: Prioritize tasks effectively. Use tools like project management software to track progress.
- Technical Debt: Address technical debt proactively to avoid future maintenance issues.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions of the software.
- Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between different components or modules.
- System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets expectations. Â  


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts or instructions to guide AI models in generating desired outputs. It's essential for interacting with AI models because the quality of the output depends heavily on the quality of the prompt.
It is like creating a special recipe for your robot. Just like a recipe tells you exactly what ingredients to use and how to mix them to bake a delicious cake, a prompt tells the robot exactly what information you need and how you want it presented.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague - Write something about a boy.
- Improved - Write a short story about a nigerian boy who dreams of becoming an architect.
